# Lazy Allocator

Lazy Allocator is a Python program for allocating savings to a fixed portfolio.
For example saving £100 a month to a defined portfolio such as 60% equities and 40% bonds. If those are represented by multiple trackers, each of a different price, it may not be clear how to allocate the £100 a month to each fund; especially as the prices of each will fluctuate over time.

## Usage
